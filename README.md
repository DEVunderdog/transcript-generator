You can try out the API using Swagger UI
[transcript-generator-api] https://transcript-generator-backend-29185933434.asia-south1.run.app/swagger/index.html

To understand system design of application please check out the blog I have written about it:
[system of transcript generator]https://transcript-generator.hashnode.dev/transcript-generator

Please note that to save up my cloud billing you can't use the API service, but if you wanted to try it out please let me know by emailing me at farhankhoja098@gmail.com and I will start the SQL Instance and you can try it out.

Thanks :)
